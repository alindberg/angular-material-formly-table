### Create in-line forms using Angular, NGX-Formly with the Material UI

A simple demonstration of using NGX-Formly with the Material UI to create an table with in-line forms.  The inspiration for this is from the [Repeating Section example on
formly.dev](https://formly.dev/examples/advanced/repeating-section)

The project uses two custom types:
- `Button` type
- `Table` type

This example is based on **`Angular`** and **`Material` 11.2** and **`ngx-formly` 5.10** 

The demo is located on [StackBlitz.com](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-material-formly-table?file=src/app/app.module.ts)

Enjoy.
